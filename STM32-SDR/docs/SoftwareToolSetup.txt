Software Tool setup for STW32-SDR (Software Defined HAM Radio)

General source for tools install guide:
	http://hertaville.com/2012/05/28/gcc-arm-toolchain-stm32f0discovery/

GCC Compiler for ARM:
---------------------
	https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download
	File: gcc-arm-none-eabi-*_*-****q*-*********.exe
		Use Version 4.6.2 (released 2012-10-31)
		Version 4.7 does not work (FFT and PSK does not display....)

	Install (IMPORTANT): 
	********************
		* Final screen, check:
		  "Add path to environment variable" so complier can be executed by Make without any configuration.

	Test:
		* Open a command prompt
		* Type: 
			arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
		  Should show long dump of configuration and build version.
	
GnuWin (for Make): 
------------------
	http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
	- Select the "Setup program" link in the Download section (hard to see).

	File: make-*.**.exe
		Lastest should work.
		Charley using 3.81

	Install:
		* Make need to uninstall conflicting MAKE program, if any.
		* Add to the path:
		  - Control panel --> System --> Advanced System Settings
		  - Advanced tab --> Environment Variables
		  - Edit the PATH variable under user (top section).
		  - Append to end:
			;C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin
			** DO NOT LEAVE A SPACE BEFORE THE ';'! **

ST-Link (Download to the STM32F4-Discovery board):
--------------------------------------------------
	http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM146/CL1984/SC720/SS1454/PF219866
	Listed as: "STSW-LINK004 	STM32 ST-LINK utility"
	File:      STM32 ST-LINK Utility_v2.5.0.exe
	Windows 8: Disable authenticated driver install 
		(temporary, requires reboot)


Eclipse:
	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
	File: Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers

	Extract the ZIP file anywhere you like.
	- Create shortcut to desktop of the eclipse.exe file after extraction.


GDB Debugging:
	Directions: http://hertaville.com/2012/09/16/part-3-debugging-openocd-0-6-0/

	Eclipse Update:
		Install the "C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging" package for Eclipse
		(under Mobile and Device Development)

	OpenOCD (http://openocd.sourceforge.net/)
		Download Binaries: http://www.freddiechopin.info/en/download/category/4-openocd
		- Currently using 0.7x
		- Newer versions should work.

		Requires STM Link to be installed for USB drivers

	Installation:
		- Extract the openocd-X.Y.Z folder anywhere.
		- Add its bin/ to path: bin/ for 32bit machines; bin-x64 64-bit windows
			Find 32 vs 64 by running: sysdm.cpl, general tab
		- Test by opening a command prompt and...
		  on a 64-bit Machine, enter:
		      openocd-x64-0.7.0.exe --version 
		  on a 32-bit Machine, enter:
		      openocd-0.7.0.exe --version 

	Use:
		- Launch the GDB server:  (change exe name and path as apporpriate)
			openocd-x64-0.7.0 -f C:\PathToYourStuff\openocd-0.7.0\scripts\board\stm32f4discovery.cfg
			openocd-0.7.0 -f C:\PathToYourStuff\openocd-0.7.0\scripts\board\stm32f4discovery.cfg
		  Ex:
			openocd-x64-0.7.0 -f E:\Work\DFM\DaveHAMRadio\openocd-0.7.0\scripts\board\stm32f4discovery.cfg

		Should see:
			Open On-Chip Debugger 0.7.0 (2013-05-05-10:44)
			Licensed under GNU GPL v2
			For bug reports, read
					http://openocd.sourceforge.net/doc/doxygen/bugs.html
			srst_only separate srst_nogate srst_open_drain connect_deassert_srst
			Info : This adapter doesn't support configurable speed
			Info : STLINK v2 JTAG v16 API v2 SWIM v0 VID 0x0483 PID 0x3748
			Info : Target voltage: 2.856743
			Info : stm32f4x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints

		Leave the command window open so GDB server executes while trying to debug.

		- Via eclipse, configure the debug settings (as per directions above) and then just debug.

Git Resources:
----------------------
My YouTube tutorials (see the Git section):
http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/276/bfraser/videolist.html

A free book (online) with great explanations of Git. It uses the command line (whereas I propose we use the Eclipse graphical tools), but it's explanations are quite clear. I especially recommend sections 3.1 through 3.5, and 5.1 and 5.2.
http://git-scm.com/book/en/

Tutorials (step-by-step exercises) for using Eclipse with Git.

Eclipse's plugin that gives us Git support (named EGit) has a pretty good manual:
