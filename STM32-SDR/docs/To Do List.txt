- EEPROM not written after every change
	- Put on Options screen, and left-push-button (give LCD feedback? How?)
	
- Create GUI screen for existing components.
	- Options menu: Have daily params on first screen, calibration on second layer screen?
		- Move "reset to defaults" to a sub-screen (vs main screen).
		- Remove code for left 16-position selcetor switch (leave commented out because others may want it back).

- Frequency band selection screen 
	- w/ reset to defaults for each band
	- Remove code for right 16-position selector switch
	- Move last two "frequency" bands to the options.

- Code:
	- Change Makefile to allow easier compilation of multiple directories
	- Move GUI code?
	- Remove User_Button?
	- Remove touch_pad.h/.c?



- Indictation that USB keyboard attached

- UI Look:
	- Larger frequency display
	- Regenerate buttons to have black background.

- Handle pressing-in knobs: Save current? Reset to default? Change how much is selected (right knob)?
- Screen to edit the PSK macros.
- Re-engineer I2C access into: high level access {EEPROM, ..., ...}, low level {I2C commands}
- Check-in coding standard
- Hardware calibration and self-test feature/screen
- Associtade a mode (PSK, CW, SSB; SSB, USB) with each frequency band.
