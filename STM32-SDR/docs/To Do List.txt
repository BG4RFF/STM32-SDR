- Code:
	- Remove User_Button?
	- Remove touch_pad.h/.c?
	- Move GUI code?

- UI Look:
	- Larger frequency display
	- Regenerate buttons to have black background.
- Handle pressing-in knobs: Save current? Reset to default? Change how much is selected (right knob)?

- Create GUI screen for existing components.
	- Mode button; upper left
	- Options menu: Have daily params on first screen, calibration on second layer screen
- Change Makefile to allow easier compilation of multiple directories
- Re-engineer I2C access into: high level access {EEPROM, ..., ...}, low level {I2C commands}
- Check-in coding standard
- Hardware calibration and self-test feature/screen
