Brian's To Do List
- Mode selection:
	- Change to be CW [CW, LSB], CWR [CW, USB], PSK [PSK, USB], LSB [SSB, LSB], USB [SSB, USB]
	- Display on main screen shows only the mode (side band implicit in the mode)
	- Mode selection screen shows buttons for only the modes, not side bands.
	- Mode selection screen automatically finishes when selecting a mode (no done button)

- Code:
	- Change Makefile to allow easier compilation of multiple directories
	- Remove the code for the 16-position encoder.
	- Move GUI code?
	- Remove User_Button?
	- Remove touch_pad.h/.c?
	- Remove TFT_Display.h/c.?
	
- USB debubing
	- Indictation that USB keyboard attached
	- USB working with new board

- Frequency band selection screen 
	- Remove code for right 16-position selector switch
	- Move last two "frequency" bands to the options.
	- w/ reset to defaults for each band

- Allow operation without SI570
	- I2C to EEPROM should still work & device run at full speed after detecting no SI570.
	- Display error messages on screen.

- UI Look:
	- Larger frequency display
	- Regenerate buttons to have black background.
	- For each option, store a "dirty" bit which indicates it's not yet written to EEPROM after a change.
	  Make the UI display dirty values differently than "clean" (different colour?)
	- Display feedback when user pressed a "save to EEPROM" button or the like.
	- Pressing left/right button displays message that stays on screen; Change functionality or display method.

- Handle pressing-in knobs: Save current? Reset to default? Change how much is selected (right knob)?
- Screen to edit the PSK macros.
- Re-engineer I2C access into: high level access {EEPROM, ..., ...}, low level {I2C commands}
- Check-in coding standard
- Hardware calibration and self-test feature/screen
- Associtade a mode (PSK, CW, SSB; SSB, USB) with each frequency band.
