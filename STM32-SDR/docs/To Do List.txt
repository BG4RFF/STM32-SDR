* FFT clicks reading to the left; box problem?
* Black background
* Mode button; upper left

- Test changing a lable's text and updating.
- Create GUI screen for existing components.
	- Options component: Have daily params on first screen, calibration on second layer screen
	- Frequency component
	- FFT component
	- Make a change mode button.
- Change Makefile to allow easier compilation of multiple directories
- Store calibration constants in EEPROM; validate on read.
- Re-engineer I2C access into: high level access {EEPROM, ..., ...}, low level {I2C commands}
- Check-in coding standard
